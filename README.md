# Prayer Times

Mono-repository containing a prayer times application designed for various platforms. The prayer times data is sourced from the https://time.my-masjid.com/ API associated with the "Islamiska Förbundet i Malmö."

The "my-masjid" project already offers a well-crafted Android and web application for displaying prayer times. This repository primarily focuses on developing a lightweight version of the Android app and generating a JAR (Java Archive) file that can serve as a desktop application.
